# EASH: Evil ass shell
EASH (pronounced eeysh, though i would rather have you just say the full name each time) is a TUI based shell that is
supposed to make the terminal environment more fun and interactive through animation, gradients, etc.
Performance is Dead. Accesibility is Long-Gone. Adaptibility has been Abandoned. This is all that's left.

Currently EASH is hacked together at best. A lot of shortcuts have been taken so if you take one wrong step the program
will immediately kill itself without warning. Sorry.
Additionally, a lot of the code is more of an imperative slopfest than I would like it to be, because I lack proper
rust experience. If you see something that could be implemented in a more idiomatic, performant or generally cleaner way,
please let me know by opening a PR, an issue, or just messaging me directly. I would really appreciate it.
